# Tasks - Minimalist Task Manager

<i>Tasks</i> is a minimalist task manager for browsers build with JavaScript, HTML & CSS. It only stores your data <b>locally</b>, so you're always able to choose whether to stay or leave the application at any time and all your tasks you remain! <sub>unless you clear your cache/local storage ðŸ˜…</sub>.
