# Tasks - Minimalist Task Manager

<i>Tasks</i> is a minimalist task manager for browsers build with JavaScript, HTML & CSS. It only stores your data <b>locally</b>, so you're always able to choose whether to stay or leave the application at any time - unless you clear your cache/local storage 😅.

Take a glance of the application <a href="https://pzzzl.github.io/tasks/">here</a>!
